                    the level of cleanliness I am able to provide for their yards or event spaces.

        <div><p class="twocol-mtg-text" id="second-paragraph-mtg">My two girls, Daisy and Tayla, are <em>poop machines!</em> The amount of doody these
                    two dogs generate is crazy!  Their pen was always full of it, and it made walking around the backyard hazardous.
                    I have them to thank for my inspiration to create this service. When looking for a business to start, I immediately honed in
                    on a pet-based business, as I love animals of all shapes and sizes.  Problem being: I have little money and work a full-time job.

        <div><p class="twocol-mtg-text">So in an effort to find I low-cost business that I can work during my two off-days a week, I stumbled upon this Pet Waste Management idea.
                        My dream is that I quit my full-time job, and expand my business to do more to care for pets than just pick up their waste.  With the help of my clients,
                    I hope to expand my services to Pet Day-Care/Boarding, Dog-Walking, Dog-Training, and Animal Rescue.
